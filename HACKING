Contributing to syslog-notify (2 January 2009)
==============================================

Compiling a git pull
--------------------
syslog-notify uses the GNU build system. configure and related scripts
are automatically generated at release time and thus not stored in the
git repository. Thus they will need to be generated if you wish to compile
the sources from git.

Information on the GNU build system is available at
http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/manual/autoconf.html
and
http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/automake.html
You will need to have autoconf, automake, and autoheader installed. Then
run:
autoreconf --install
in the top-level directory (i.e. the one with configure.ac)
